# Specialization_Planner

### The specialization Planner project aims to create an application in which students from LTH can choose courses for their specialization and at the same time check that they fulfill the requirements of the course. The application will provide statistics about how close the student are to fulfilling the necessary points for the specializations/csn.

### The planner also aims to help uncertain students finish their planning, the planner takes these criteria into consideration:
* Study pace
* Number of Advanced level points
* Number of points in specialization
* CSN requirments
