# Specialization_Planner

### The specialization Planner project aims to create an application in which students from LTH can choose courses for their specialization and at the same time check that they fulfill the requirements of the course. The application will provide statistics about how many points the student has chosen within the specializations and whether this choice of courses gives them the right to apply for csn.

### The planner also aims to help uncertain students finish their planning, the planner takes these criteria into consideration:
* Study pace
* Number of Advanced level points
* Number of points in specialization
* CSN requirments
